# KSP-ELK-Grafana

This repository documents a project of a rocket launch in KSP and shows the results on Grafana.

There is a lot of available states we can get from the game. States describe flight parameters, different velocities, different kind of angles, G-Force, even humidity, wind, pressure and atmosphere density. The game itself is a pretty good physics simulator.
